# FTC_SDK
This is the repo that holds all the java android stuff.

To work with the SDK you need [ Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

To open this project, open android studio, click open project, and then select the folder called ftc_app-master. 
#####NOTE: If you are on OS X, the above will NOT work. Android Studio for OS X has some bugs, and at this time is unable to correctly import a gradle project (Which this is).

## Where Things Are :)
The files that really matter are certain java files that FTC calls OPs.

These java files are located in [ftc_app-master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/com/qualcomm/ftcrobotcontroller/opmodes](https://github.com/RoboticColonels/FTC_SDK/tree/master/ftc_app-master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/com/qualcomm/ftcrobotcontroller/opmodes).

They are for setting what controls on the controllers control what things on the robot.
